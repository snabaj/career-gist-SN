//Defining Props for the Component
  // jobs: Job[] → The list of jobs passed as a prop to be displayed.
  // onSave: (job: Job) => void → A function prop that handles job-saving actions.

//Functional Component Definition
  // JobList is a functional component that accepts jobs and onSave as props.
  // Uses TypeScript’s React Functional Component (React.FC) for type safety.
  //rendering the list of jobs

  <ul>
    {jobs.map(job => (
      <li key={job.id}>
        <h2>{job.title} at {job.company}</h2>
        <p>{job.description}</p>
        <a href={job.url} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View Job</a>

//Key Points:
  //Keeping this file since we don't want the HomePage to be also responsible for rendering the job list.
  //This file separates concerns (as Jason has advised). HomePage.tsx fetches data, while this displays it
  //This makes the code more modular and easier to maintain.
  //If we need to show the job list on another page, we won't have to rewrite the logic

  //We can also re-use it instead of duplicating job list rendering logic
